# MovieProjectMVC
This is a C# proect made with ASP.Net, 
Identity, and Entity. If you have Visual Studio you can open it.

The instructions to access the manager account are on the home page. 
You will have to do a migration to SqlServer and update-database if 
you want to create a database and have full functionality. 
This is a mock up of a movie site where users can register and 
a manager can manage roles and users. Users can see a list of movies they matched. etc.
